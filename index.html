                    <p>This is my very first project for General Assembly. It consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a touch
                        of jQuery. Out of the 4 projects that the students could choose from for the first project, this
                        was one of the most difficult ones. I decided to challenge myself even though I had no experience
                        with coding before the course. I was surprised and satisfied by the outcome.</p>

                    <p>For the second project in General Assembly, I decided to make a brewery app that allows users to share
                        their experiences at certain breweries. This is my first full stack application, using HTML, CSS,
                        JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and many more libraries. The list of total libraries used
                        can be found in my github.</p>

                        CRUD. I decided to use my previous medical background and build a basic electronic medical record.
                        The dummy user and login for this page is 'Doctor Jay' and 'password1' for the username and password.</p>

                        and editing/deleting your own comment for that movie! The dummy user and login for this page is 'test@tester.com'
